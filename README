AirKey is a central management platform for OpenWRT based access points.

Airkey is a system that will centrally configure, manage, and monitor a set of wireless access points on a network.  It simplify a number of repetitive tasks associated with configuring and maintaining access points individually, which will eliminate the legwork of having to visit each of the network’s access points web interfaces manually.  A central server exists that all access points communicate with in order to acquire their configuration once they are online.  A script resides on every access point that applies the configureation. The central server also contains a data cache for each access point’s status, history, and usage statistics.
